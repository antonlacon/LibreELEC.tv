# KettleELEC

KettleELEC is an experimental branch of LibreELEC ([https:/libreelec.tv](https://libreelec.tv)). It focuses on changes for use with the Raspberry Pi 3. Other boards have no changes, and may specifically not work. If not using the RPi3, use regular LibreELEC instead.

**Copyright**

As KettleELEC includes code from many upstream projects it includes many copyright owners. KettleELEC makes NO claim of copyright on any upstream code. However all original authored code is copyrighted. Patches to upstream code have the same license as the upstream project, unless specified otherwise. For a complete copyright list please checkout the source code to examine license headers. Unless expressly stated otherwise, all code submitted (in any form) is licensed under [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and copyright is donated to the project. This approach allows the project to stay manageable in the long term by giving us freedom to maintain the code as part of the whole without the management overhead of preserving contact with every submitter, e.g. GPLv3. You are absolutely free to retain copyright. To retain copyright simply add a copyright header to each submitted code page. If you submit code that is not your own work it is your responsibility to place a header stating the copyright.
